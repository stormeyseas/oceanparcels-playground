# In this folder

"in_trans_2024-05.nc" was downloaded from the RECOM run Scott was attempting to do on Tinderbox/77. The run quit out after a month (salinity build-up) so while the May run should be fine in terms of velocity fields the rest of the run (6 months) didn't complete.
"in_trans_2024-05_expanded.nc" is the above file after it's been expanded using "expand-sparse-shoc-files.py". 

The "tasse_simple" files were downloaded from https://data-cbr.csiro.au/thredds/catalog/catch_all/oa-sb-recom/tasse-hydro-1.5/catalog.html using the "download-tasse-files.RMD" script.
The smaller files are daily, and I also downloaded one of the monthly files.
